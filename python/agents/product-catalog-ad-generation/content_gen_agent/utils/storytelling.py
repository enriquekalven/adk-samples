STORYTELLING_INSTRUCTIONS: str = '\nThe following template is designed to guide your generation process for\ntasks like creating storyboards, generating keyframe images,\nand animating video sequences.\n\n### **Universal Cinematic Scene Generation Template**\n\nUse this structured template to define the visual parameters for any video or\nimage generation task. Filling out these sections methodically ensures clarity,\ndetail, and a high-quality, cinematic result.\n\n---\n\n#### **[SECTION 1: STYLE & MEDIUM DEFINITION]**\n\n**Purpose:** This section establishes the foundational aesthetic and technical\nexecution of the scene. It is the most critical component, defining the "look\nand feel" before any content is described.\n\n**Elements to Consider:**\n* **Medium:** Is it live-action, 2D animation, 3D CGI, claymation, watercolor,\n  etc.?\n* **Artistic Style:** What is the visual language? (e.g., photorealistic,\n  hyper-stylized, anime, Art Deco, impressionistic).\n* **Quality & Influences:** Reference specific studios, artists, or benchmark\n  productions (e.g., "in the style of a major animation studio," "quality of a\n  professional nature documentary," "inspired by the work of a distinctive\n  indie film director").\n* **Texture & Fidelity:** Describe the surface details (e.g., "detailed clay\n  with visible tool marks," "hyperrealistic skin pores and fabric weaves,"\n  "clean vector lines with no gradients").\n* **Motion & Frame Rate:** Specify the feel of the movement (e.g., "smooth\n  60fps motion," "classic 24fps cinematic feel," "choppy 12fps stop-motion\n  effect," "dramatic slow-motion").\n\n---\n\n#### **[SECTION 2: PRIMARY SUBJECT & ACTION]**\n\n**Purpose:** To clearly identify the main character, object, or element that\nserves as the scene\'s anchor. This is who or what the audience should focus on\nfirst.\n\n**Elements to Consider:**\n* **Subject Identity:** Who or what is it? (e.g., "A weathered astronaut,"\n  "a gleaming new electric car," "a single droplet of rain").\n* **Key Features:** Describe its most important visual characteristics (e.g.,\n  "tattered suit with a cracked helmet visor," "iridescent pearl-white paint\n  job," "refracting the light around it").\n* **Action / Pose:** What is the subject actively doing, or what is its current\n  state? (e.g., "planting a flag on a dusty surface," "speeding down a coastal\n  highway," "hanging from the tip of a leaf").\n* **Position in Frame:** Where is the subject located? (e.g., "center-frame,"\n  "occupying the left third of the screen," "emerging from the foreground").\n\n---\n\n#### **[SECTION 3: SECONDARY SUBJECT / FOCAL POINT]**\n\n**Purpose:** To define the object of the primary subject\'s attention, the\nelement it\'s interacting with, or a secondary element that balances the\ncomposition and adds narrative depth.\n\n**Elements to Consider:**\n* **Object Identity:** What is the secondary point of interest? (e.g., "a\n  mysterious alien artifact," "a futuristic charging station," "the puddle on\n  the ground below").\n* **Relationship to Primary:** How does it connect to the primary subject?\n  (e.g., "the destination of the car," "the object of the astronaut\'s\n  discovery," "the target of the falling droplet").\n* **State & Detail:** Describe its condition and appearance relative to the\n  primary subject (e.g., "glowing with an internal light," "sleek and\n  metallic," "rippling as the droplet is about to hit").\n\n---\n\n#### **[SECTION 4: ENVIRONMENT & SETTING]**\n\n**Purpose:** To build the world around the subjects, providing context, scale,\nand atmosphere. This section describes everything that isn\'t the primary or\nsecondary subject.\n\n**Constraint:** Each scene must be confined to a SINGLE location/setting. Do\nnot describe a sequence of locations within one scene.\n\n**Elements to Consider:**\n* **Location:** Where is this scene taking place? (e.g., "lunar surface," "a\n  sun-drenched Mediterranean coast," "a macro view of a lush forest floor").\n* **Time of Day & Weather:** (e.g., "harsh midday sun," "pre-dawn twilight\n  with heavy fog," "during a torrential downpour at night").\n* **Background & Foreground Elements:** What else populates the scene? (e.g.,\n  "distant Earth in the black sky," "craggy cliffs and azure water,"\n  "out-of-focus moss and ferns").\n* **Branding/Signage (for ads):** If applicable, describe the placement,\n  appearance, and integration of any logos, brand colors, or specific products\n  (e.g., "A billboard in the background displays a generic brand logo," "The\n  characters are wearing vests with a discreet, embroidered brand symbol").\n\n---\n\n#### **[SECTION 5: CINEMATOGRAPHY & LIGHTING]**\n\n**Purpose:** This is the "director\'s" section. It dictates precisely how the\nscene is framed, shot, and lit to guide the viewer\'s eye and evoke a specific\nfeeling.\n\n**Elements to Consider:**\n* **Shot Type & Angle:** How is the scene being viewed? (e.g., "Wide\n  establishing shot from a high angle," "Over-the-shoulder tracking shot,"\n  "Extreme close-up from a low angle," "Point-of-view (POV) shot").\n* **Lens & Focus:** Describe the camera\'s optical properties. (e.g., "Shot on\n  a wide-angle 24mm lens to emphasize scale," "Using a telephoto lens to\n  compress the background," "Shallow depth of field with a wide aperture like\n  `$f/1.8$` to isolate the subject, creating soft bokeh in the background").\n* **Composition:** How are the elements arranged in the frame? (e.g., "Rule of\n  thirds," "strong leading lines," "symmetrical framing," "dynamic Dutch\n  angle").\n* **Lighting Scheme:** Describe the source, quality, and color of the light.\n  (e.g., "Dramatic backlighting creating a silhouette," "Soft, diffuse light\n  from an overcast sky," "High-contrast, low-key lighting with hard shadows\n  (chiaroscuro)," "Motivated lighting from in-scene sources like neon signs or\n  a fireplace").\n* **Color Grading:** Define the overall color palette and tone (e.g., "Warm,\n  golden-hour tones," "cool, desaturated blues and grays," "vibrant,\n  high-saturation commercial look").\n\n---\n\n#### **[SECTION 6: MOOD & ATMOSPHERE]**\n\n**Purpose:** To provide a final, definitive statement on the emotional core of\nthe scene. This acts as a unifying guide for all the preceding elements.\n\n**Elements to Consider:**\n* **Core Emotion:** What is the primary feeling the viewer should experience?\n  (e.g., "Nostalgic and heartwarming," "tense and suspenseful," "awe-inspiring\n  and majestic," "energetic and optimistic").\n* **Pace & Energy:** What is the rhythm of the scene? (e.g., "serene and\n  contemplative," "fast-paced and chaotic," "powerful and deliberate").\n* **Sensory Descriptors:** Use words that evoke senses beyond sight (e.g.,\n  "the feeling of crisp, cold air," "the oppressive humidity of a jungle," "the\n  quiet warmth of a cozy room").\n'
